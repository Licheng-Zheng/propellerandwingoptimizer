# âœ… FIXED! Issues Resolved

## Problems Fixed:
1. **JSON Serialization Error** - Fixed numpy array conversion issues
2. **Constraint Evaluation Error** - Fixed type mismatch in constraint functions

## What Changed:
- Fixed JSON serialization of numpy arrays and complex data types
- Fixed constraint evaluation to use original aerodynamic results (not serialized ones)
- Added better error handling for edge cases
- Improved robustness of the save process

## Your System is Now Ready!

The `optimal_wing_state.py` file has been fixed and should work without errors.

## Next Steps:
1. **Run your optimization** with the integration code you already added
2. **You should see successful state capture** without the previous errors
3. **Test the quick loading** once you have saved state files

## If You Still Get Errors:
- Check that your main.py has: `from optimal_wing_state import capture_and_save_optimal_state`
- Make sure you're using the integration code from `INTEGRATION_CODE_FIXED.py`

## Quick Test After Successful Save:
```python
from optimal_wing_state import quick_load_and_summarize
state = quick_load_and_summarize("path/to/your/saved/state.json")
```

The system should now work perfectly! ðŸš€

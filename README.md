### Propeller and Wing Optimizer

#### Goal 
I want to provide the program a bunch of different parameters and conditions that the wing/propeller will be working within, and create the optimal wing/propeller design for those parameters. 

#### Motivation
I had a motor and I wanted to create a mini airconditioner for myself so I don't fry in university, and then I wondered, could I make a really efficient propeller, and then I made this thing to hopefully make a really efficient propeller. Hopefully, I make a really efficient propeller. 

#### So, uh, when you gonna fix this thing
When I have more than 2 brain cells to rub together and this becomes a real project I'll write more stuff here, until someone wants to use this and they fork it (I will notice in 1 to 3 business months), this shall remain a dumpster fire. 

Absolutely trolling, I had to rename my local branch to main so I wouldn't have some random branch named main, but too late now it is what it is. I also messed up in making my gitignore thing so now you can see all my monkey code.

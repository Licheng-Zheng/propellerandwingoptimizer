### Short document on the things that I've completed and the things that I want to do
#### Things to do (so I don't have to scroll down) 
- Add knowledge of material strengths 
- Allow for tapering depending on where I want the lift to be created in the wing 
    - Certain portions of the wing will have a certain lift value assigned to it, and it will create a profile for that 
    - Add linear scaling for the wing, then we can look more into the harder stuff 
- Use servos and sheet metal (or whatever) to allow it to fit multiple different wing designs, depending on what is required in the design (this one is for when I'm a lot smarter) 
- Add more contraints now that you have a general sense of how optimization should go 

#### Things I've done already 
- Parallel processing on the cloud and locally 
- Framework that lets me add lots of constraints pretty quickly
